# WINDOWS USERS: The '\' character is not supported by Maven.  Do not use the '\' character in your file paths.
# Replace any '\' characters with the '/'.  The '/' works as a file path separator on UNIX and WINDOWS.

# NOTE: All file paths should be absolute, not relative to the xnat_builder folder. This means that, if your
# pipeline or modules folder is in the same relative folder as your xnat_builder folder, you should still use 
# the full path to those folders instead of ../pipeline or ../modules.
