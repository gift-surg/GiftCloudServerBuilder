NOTE:  When under the projects directory, this is the location to put jar dependencies that are specified
in "projects/[project]/project-dependencies/dependencies.xml", but are not available in a central Maven repository.
Files and directories placed here will be copied into the plugin-resources/repository directory (the local 
maven repository) that contains XNAT-supplied dependency files and any dependencies downloaded from a remote
maven repository.  These dependency files will be made available for program compilation during the build phase 
as well as for deployment with the web application.

Jar files should not be placed at the top level of this directory.  Rather, dependencies placed here should
be organized as expected in a Maven repository, in accordance with their specification in "dependencies.xml",
so they can located by Maven.  For information regarding this, please consult Maven project documentation.
