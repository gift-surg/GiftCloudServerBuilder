The fast-md5 library was written by Tim Macinta based on work by Santeri Paavolainen, with
a lot of help from others. You can find out more at:

The library as distributed with XNAT was packaged manually from the fast-md5 build output
by Rick Herrick <rick.herrick@wustl.edu>. This library currently is not configured to work
with the native code enhancements. Future versions should rectify this so that the checksum
calculation operations can be speeded up.
